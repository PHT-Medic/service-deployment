# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker

Based on the official Docker images from Elastic:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/distribution/docker)
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/master/docker)
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/dev/build/tasks/os_packages/docker_generator)

## Requirements

### Host setup

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) version **18.06.0** or newer
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.26.0** or newer
* 1.5 GB of RAM

*:information_source: Especially on Linux, make sure your user has the [required permissions][linux-postinstall] to
interact with the Docker daemon.*

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:

* 5044: Logstash Beats input
* 5000: Logstash TCP input
* 9600: Logstash monitoring API
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana

Port mapping can be done in the ```docker-compose.yaml``` file to expose only specific ports on your machine.

## Usage

**:warning: You must rebuild the stack images with `docker-compose build` whenever you switch branch or update the
[version](#version-selection) of an already existing stack.**

### Bringing up the stack

After cloning this respository, start the stack's services locally using Docker
Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

*:information_source: You can also run all services in the background (detached mode) by appending the `-d` flag to the
above command.*

Give Kibana about a minute to initialize, then access the Kibana web UI by opening ```http://<ip-adress>:<kibana-port>``` in a web
browser and use the specified credentials in your `.env` file to log in.


### Cleanup

Elasticsearch data is persisted inside a volume by default.

In order to entirely shutdown the stack and remove all persisted data, use the following Docker Compose command:

```console
$ docker-compose down -v
```


## Configuration

*:information_source: Configuration is not dynamically reloaded, you will need to restart individual components after
any configuration change.*

### How to configure Elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch configuration is stored in [`elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml`][config-es].

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
elasticsearch:

  environment:
    network.host: _non_loopback_
    cluster.name: my-cluster
```

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Elasticsearch inside Docker
containers: [Install Elasticsearch with Docker][es-docker].

### How to configure Kibana

The Kibana default configuration is stored in [`kibana/config/kibana.yml`][config-kbn].

When installing the elastic stack on a new system you must change the `elasticsearch.hosts` variable`in the ```kibana.yaml``` file to the corresponding
ip adress of your hardware:

```
elasticsearch.hosts: [ "http://<your_ip_adress>:<elasticsearch_port>" ]
```

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
kibana:

  environment:
    SERVER_NAME: kibana.example.org
```

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Kibana inside Docker
containers: [Install Kibana with Docker][kbn-docker].

### How to configure Logstash

The Logstash configuration is stored in [`logstash/config/logstash.yml`][config-ls].

In the `logstash.yml` you must again change the `elasticsearch.hosts` variable to the corresponding
ip adress of your hardware:

```
output {
	elasticsearch {
	 hosts => "http://<your_ip_adress>:<elasticsearch_port>" 
	 }
}
```

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
logstash:

  environment:
    LOG_LEVEL: debug
```

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Logstash inside Docker
containers: [Configuring Logstash for Docker][ls-docker].

### How to scale out the Elasticsearch cluster

Follow the instructions from the Wiki: [Scaling out Elasticsearch](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk/wiki/Elasticsearch-cluster)

### How to reset a password programmatically

If for any reason your are unable to use Kibana to change the password of your users (including [built-in
users][builtin-users]), you can use the Elasticsearch API instead and achieve the same result.

In the example below, we change the password of the `elastic` user (notice "/user/elastic" in the URL):

```API call
$ POST 'http://<ip>:<elasticsearch_port>/_security/user/elastic/_password' 
    
      {
         "password" : "<your new password>"
      }
```

In general this needs to be repeated for the `kibana_system` user. And keep in mind to update the changed 
password in the `.env` file. 

## Extensibility

### How to add plugins

To add plugins to any ELK component you have to:

1. Uncomment the corresponding service in the `docker-compose.yml` file of the root directory
1. Rebuild the images using the `docker-compose build` command
